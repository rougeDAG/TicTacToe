# TicTacToe
A first year semester project I submitted for my course in Digital System Design. This is a Tic Tac Toe game that uses only digital logic to play the game.PCB Design was done on KiCad , an open source PCB Design software. I simulated the circuit in another open source digital simulator called Digital.exe by hneemann which is based on Logisim.

 To open the files in KiCad, go to KiCad, click on File->Open Project and then open the file folder thats downloaded and click on "DSD_Project" of the file type "KiCad Project 9.0". Updated versions may come in the future but it still should work the same.

 To open the files in Digital.exe, go to Digital, click on Open and click on the downloaded file folder.
