# TicTacToe
A first year semester project I submitted for my course in Digital System Design. This is a Tic Tac Toe game that uses only digital logic to play the game.PCB Design was done on KiCad , an open source PCB Design software. I simulated the circuit in another open source digital simulator called Digital.exe by hneemann which is based on Logisim.
