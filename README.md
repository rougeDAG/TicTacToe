<h1>TicTacToe</h1>

A first year graded project I submitted for my course in Digital System Design (Winter Semester, Vellore Institue of Technology, Chennai). This is a Tic Tac Toe game that uses only digital logic to play the game. PCB Design was done on KiCad , an open source PCB Design software. I simulated the circuit in another open source digital simulator called Digital.exe (which is based on another software called Logisim) by Helmut Neemann which I downloaded from his GitHub repository.
Digital.exe helped me immensely in my project as I cannot have simulated my project without this software for free. Here is his GitHub repository: github.com/hneemann/Digital

Now for KiCad, I used another free and open source software called Freerouting by Andras Fuchs to auto-route my wire connections in KiCad. Here is that GitHub repository: github.com/freerouting/freerouting
Again it would've been painstaking to connect all the components pinouts invidivually , thus this software also played a massively role in saving time as I had to submit my project in a short span of time.


 To open the files in KiCad, go to KiCad, click on File->Open Project and then open the file folder thats downloaded and click on "DSD_Project" of the file type "KiCad Project 9.0". Updated versions may come in the future but it still should work the same.

 To open the files in Digital.exe, go to Digital, click on Open and click on "dsd_project_digital.dig".
